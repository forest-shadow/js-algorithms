# Multiple Pointers Pattern

- Creating **pointers** or values that correspond to an index or position and move towards the beginning, end or middle based on a certain condition.
- **Very** efficient for solving problems with minimal space complexity as well.

## Challenges

- [Count unique values in sorted array](https://github.com/forest-shadow/js-algorithms/tree/master/multiple-pointers/countUniqueValues)
- [Zero summary pair from sorted array](https://github.com/forest-shadow/js-algorithms/tree/master/multiple-pointers/sumZero)
