# Frequency counter pattern usage examples

* This pattern uses objects or sets to collect values/frequencies of values.
* This can often avoid the need for nested loops or `O(N^2)` operations with arrays / strings.

Frequency counter stands from utilization of object like collection of character counters. Each property represents some character and value signifies it's frequency in some array/string.
