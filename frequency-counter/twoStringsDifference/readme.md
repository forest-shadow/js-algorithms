# Find the two strings difference

You are given two strings `s` and `t`.

String `t` is generated by random shuffling string `s` and then add one more letter at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to `t`.


```js
twoStringsDifference('abcd', 'abcde')  // 'e'
twoStringsDifference('', 'y')          // y
```
