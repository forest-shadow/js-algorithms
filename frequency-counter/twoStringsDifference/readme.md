# Find the two strings difference

You are given two strings `str1` and `str2`.

String `str2` is generated by random shuffling string `str1` and then add one more letter at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to `str2`.


```js
twoStringsDifference('abcd', 'abcde')  // 'e'
twoStringsDifference('', 'y')          // y
```
