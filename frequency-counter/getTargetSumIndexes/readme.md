# Return integer array elements indices such they add up to target integer

### Description
Given an array of integers and an integer target. Write function returning indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

* Each input array would have only one solution
* The same element couldn't be used twice.
* Indexes could be returned in any order.

### Implementation details

```js
getTargetSumIndexes([2, 1, 2, 6, 4], 7);  // [1, 3]
getTargetSumIndexes([2, 1, 2, 6, 4], 7);  // [1, 4]
```
